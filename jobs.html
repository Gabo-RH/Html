    It's 2024, and AI has already started replacing humans in the workforce. Cashiers? Gone.
    Drivers? Replaced by self-driving cars. Pretty soon, your boss will be a cold, heartless machine
    (if it isn’t already). And let's be real, they’ll probably do a better job managing too...

    Just imagine: You wake up one day, go to work, and *boom* – you're training your replacement.
    Except this time, it's not your co-worker... it's a machine that never takes a bathroom break,
    never asks for a raise, and never complains about free donuts.
